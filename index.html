                            Prince of Songkhla University. While the original club focused on combat performances, when
                            it closed,
                            three passionate fire twirlers reunited and formed a new team. We have gained experience
                            performing full-scale fire shows at hotels and events both inside and outside Phuket,
                            creating captivating stories told through flames.
