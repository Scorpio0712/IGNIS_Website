                    <p><span>IGNIS</span> is a fire performance team founded by students from
                        Prince of Songkhla University. While the original club focused on combat performances, when
                        it closed,
                        three passionate fire twirlers reunited and formed a new team. We have gained experience
                        performing full-scale fire shows at hotels and events both inside and outside Phuket,
                        creating captivating stories told through flames.

                    <p>We have also developed a new type of show: LED or Pixel Light. These
                        shows are suitable for both indoor and outdoor performances, and can be creatively created
                        with a variety of elements, including logos and images, to create memorable and engaging
                        performances for the audience. IGNIS has earned the trust of our customers because we value
                        feedback and are always ready to improve and develop our shows to the best of our ability.
